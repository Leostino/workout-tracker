# workout-tracker

## Introduction

This is a nodejs application with express and mongodb. It helps users record their workouts so they can view their progress in a well detailed format.

## Overview

I started this project because I was tired of tracking my workout in complicated spreadsheets. I wanted a nice GUI interface to track my workouts. I also wanted to create a tool that was easier for others to understand and use. Lastly, I wanted to be able to access my workout tracking tool from my phone. Editing a spreadsheet on a mobile device is just terrible.

## Instructions

This app has 3 workouts - running, biking and bench press. The 3 most common workouts people do at the gym or out on the street. When the page loads, you create your username. Ather that, you can record your workouts mostly you'd want to track the duration of the workout and distance. Bench press has weight (in pounds) and laps. After each record, click the "submit" button to save your records in database. You can view your records by clicking "view workouts" button. This will help you see how well you progressing or what you need to work on.

## Icebox - future development

* User account and password to track each user.
* User profile with pictures and demography.
* User can add and edit their workouts. This Makes the app more flexible.
* Add "calories lost" and "set goals" as one of the fields to track.
* Use a progress chart to represent user's progress, so it's easier to understand.
* Make the app more mobile friendly. This is my main goal so users's don't use spreadsheets
